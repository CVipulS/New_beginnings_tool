# New Beginnings: Personal Growth Productivity Tool

## Overview
This project is for individuals wanting to be productive on new beginnings for personal growth. They must be having a theme to pursue. It groups the tasks related to the theme into categories, and sequences those categories as an everyday agenda. As tasks get resolved, the user can continue with substitution by successive tasks. GitHub model LLMs may also help with identifying substitute tasks.
